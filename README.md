## A Primer on Process Mining: Practical Skills with Python and Graphviz

This repository contains the source code for the book [A Primer on Process Mining: Practical Skills with Python and Graphviz](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783319564265).

Most examples are based on the small log file `eventlog.csv`. Some figures and results have been generated using the larger log file `eventlog_large.csv`.

In Chapter 5, we use a log file that is referred to as `financial_log.xes`. This file can be obtained from [4TU.ResearchData](https://data.4tu.nl/repository/uuid:3926db30-f712-4394-aebc-75976070e91f).
